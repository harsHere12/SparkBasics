# Spark Learning Journey
Welcome to my Spark learning repository! This repo will contain all my code, experiments, and notes as I dive deeper into Apache Spark.

Overview
This repository is dedicated to learning and experimenting with Apache Spark. I will be exploring various features, capabilities, and techniques within Spark, including but not limited to:

Spark Core (RDDs, DataFrames, Datasets)
Spark SQL
PySpark
Spark Streaming
Machine Learning with Spark MLlib
Goals
Get hands-on experience with Apache Spark and its components.
Learn how to use Spark for large-scale data processing.
Push my code and learning resources as I progress.
Work with PySpark for specific Python-based Spark implementations.
